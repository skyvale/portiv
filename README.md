# Project &amp; Portfolio IV

This is my repository for my Port IV class at Full Sail.

This month, I worked on developing my art portfolio website. The website will be used as a gallery for my art, as
well as a place for prospective commissioners to get in contact with me. Although I already conduct my business using 
various social media (such as Instagram and DeviantArt), having a personal website will boost my professionalism and
possibly open me up to working with new and different clients.
