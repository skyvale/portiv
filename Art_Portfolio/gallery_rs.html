                                    character! I really love the colours and the design of this closed species.
                                    I tried something new with the shading here and it was much faster than my
                                    normal method of shading. I'm trying to zoom out more when drawing so that
                                    'less is more', so to speak.</p>

                                    tricked into betraying Rapunzel. I hope she is redeemed in the end. I

                                <h3>Would you like to dance?</h3>
                                <p> For a content on NA, I drew a gijinka version of my northling OC, Sonder!
                                    I enjoy otome games, so I wanted to draw him as a romancable character in 
                                    one. A fake screenshot, if you will. It would be cool if I could make my 
                                    own otome game one day, but my anime drawing skills definitely need some 
                                    work before then.
                                </p>
                                <p> Would you dance with him? I'm surprising he had the courage to ask, since
                                    Sonder is normally a very shy and withdrawn persona.

                                <p> One of my favourite commissions I did for Inktober 2019. This was a commissions
                                    for <span>Eeveeandocs</span> on Instagram! I relate to this character. Spending
                                    long nights up in front of a screen, staring at broken code, wanting desperately 
                                    to sleep but knowing you have a project that is due the next day...

                                <p> I love the style I managed in this drawing! I tried to utilize a field blur affect
                                    and it really made things look good. I also changed my painting style a smidge- I
                                    added eyelashes and ribs on the horn, the eyes are different and I spent less time
                                    on the hair. I like the soft, elegant look it turned out with though! I hope I can 
                                    draw something this good again.

                                    lovely OC and I can't wait to try redrawing this next year to see how much I've

                                   painting humans one day, and I think this is a decent start.
