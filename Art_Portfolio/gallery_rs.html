                                <p>A very peaceful drawing. I wish I could sit in a tree and watch the 
                                    fireflies. I don't think they have them where I live now- plus, there
                                    are much more dangerous bugs and parasites around. Nope.

                                <p> This art is the result of an art swap with my best friend, Mossillus on Instagram! 
                                    I did the sketch, she did the line work, and then I went in and finished the colouring
                                    and shading! The character is Honeydew, a dragon oc that belongs to Mossi. I like how 
                                    it turned out. Art swaps are a lot of fun!

                                <p> One of my favourite arts of all time, because I love the combination of
                                    red and blue. Red comes forward, and blue recedes, as cool colours do. 
                                    This art always had a bit of a 3D effect to it that I love. Plus, the 
                                    character is very cool, and the art is a commission for a friend of mine-
                                    KonnyArt on Instagram.

                                <p> An OC I was given by a random person on EA. His name is Overcast and he 
                                    is a pegasus that lost his eye sight in an accident. He re-learned how to fly
                                    by sensing the change in air currents, and he practices at night in the mountains
                                    to avoid running into any other pegasi.

                                <p> This was one of my most difficult commissions, since I'm not all that comfortable
                                    with drawing detailed backgrounds. However, out of all the backgrounds I could try
                                    drawing, forests are my 'specialty'. I enjoy painting tree trunks, but the leaves
                                    are the hard part.

                                <p> This cute OC belongs to Isabae on EA! I was trying a new quick and sketchy style,
                                    and I really like how this turned out. I learned about how to create the illusion
                                    of depth by drawing a simple foreground, midground, and background.

                                <h3>Endless</h3>
                                <p>This art is my original horror character, Noah Harren, otherwise known as the 
                                    'Black Cat'. He was born with a curse that allows him to see into someone's 
                                    future against his will, however, he can only see traumatic events in that
                                    person's future. Most of the time, these are horrible accidents and death.
                                </p>
                                <p> He wears bandages around his eyes, because as long as he can't see someone,
                                    he won't see any future visions. Regardless, it seems that poor Noah causes
                                    misfortune wherever he goes.
