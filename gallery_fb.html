                                <h3>Normal Eeveelution</h3>
                                <p> A fun commission for Twiconda on Instagram! They asked me 
                                    to draw their concept for a normal-type eeveelution. I like
                                    the fluffiness! It was fun to draw something that wasn't a 
                                    pony, so I hope I can draw more pokemon.
                                </p>

                                <p> An older art for Nevermore on CAtm of their OC. I love drawing
                                    glow effects so this was fun! My human style needs more developing,
                                    but I really like how this one turned out, especially considering
                                    how fast I was able to produce it. Success!

                                <p> I designed this OC for Minetane on EA and they asked me to make a 
                                    reference sheet of them! It was my biggest commission yet at the time,
                                    so I really went all out. It turned out so great! It is one of my 
                                    proudest arts, especially considering how much the person loves the 
                                    oc I designed for them.

                                <h3>Serein</h3>
                                <p> I love designing characters. Adoptables, if you will. This particular
                                    adoptable is one of my favourite designs-- based on the word 'serein'.
                                    I referenced a twilight sky. She was quickly adopted by someone and I
                                    hope they enjoy her design as much as I do!

                                <p> Another prize art for the lovely Soso Davis on EA. This character has a lot
                                    of hair- a LOT of it. So, I drew them sleeping in their hair. I experimented
                                    with my line weight in this one and spent a much longer period of time
                                    refining the line art. It was definitely worth it, in my opinion! The colours
                                    purple and yellow work really well together here and make this art really pop!

                                <p>This art is fan art for my favourite nuzlocke comic character, Cheza, from
                                   Chiakiro's amazing nuzlocke on Deviant. It's still ongoing and, if you're a 
                                   fan of pokemon, it's definitely worth the read! It's a very dark, heart-felt 
                                   comic, and I have been reading it since early high school. It's nearly complete
                                   now, only a few strips away from completion.
